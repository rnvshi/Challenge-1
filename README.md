# <Refactoring Starter Code>

## Description

In this project, a starter code was downloaded from a remote repository and refactored to include semantic HTML tags, appropriate alt text for images for search engine optimization, broken links were fixed, and overall flow of the HTML code was made to be more logical. The accompanying CSS file was also modified to reflect the changes in HTML.

## Usage
